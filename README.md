# Advent of Code challenge

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

I have chosen to tackle these problems using  [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/).
